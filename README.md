# Uma Racing Simulator

A Python-based racing simulator inspired by Uma Musume, featuring a graphical interface, customizable race parameters, detailed commentary generation, and aptitude-based race calculations.

Note: Portions of this project were developed using AI-assisted coding, as the author is still learning. Constructive feedback and contributions are always welcome.

## Overview

The Uma Racing Simulator provides a complete toolset for creating and running simulated races for roleplay or community events, including:

* Customizable race settings
* Automated commentary output
* Aptitude and performance calculations
* Human-readable result formatting
* A graphical user interface
* A configuration generator for runners

This project was originally created for community hobby purposes and remains open for future extension.
